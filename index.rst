======================
The GET Suite of Tools
======================

GET is a suite of tools based around the concept of modelling generalised epithelial transport. The GET framework makes extensive use of `CellML <http://cellml.org>`_ and `SED-ML <http://sed-ml.org>`_, and so this suite includes some generic software for working with these standards which are included here. Demonstrations of the ideas and tools being promoted by the GET project are also listed below.
