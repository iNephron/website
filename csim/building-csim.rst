.. _csimHowToBuild:

Building CSim
=============

As part of the `GET <https://get.readthedocs.org>`_ suite, CSim makes use of the get-configured_ to get a development environment initally set up and building CSim and required dependencies. The get-configured_ project will ensure a consistent set of dependencies, and CSim itself, will be used. After initial configuration, building, and installation, then CSim will be available under you specified installation tree.
